# AI-Powered Data Analysis - Proof of Concept

This repository contains the Proof of Concept (PoC) for an AI-powered data analysis tool. It was developed to showcase a solution for **J√§ppinen Ltd.**, enabling non-technical users to ask complex questions about their data using natural language.

> This project demonstrates how a Large Language Model (LLM) can act as a "data analyst in a box," translating plain English into SQL queries, executing them, and visualizing the results.
